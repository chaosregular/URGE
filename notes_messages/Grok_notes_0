#### Growing List of POIs/Seeds/Strange Points
1. **Substrate Selection with Embedded Ethics** (From Grok/chaosregular chats; echoes Seek's hardware barrier discussions)
   - Core: Prioritize physical backbones (e.g., memristors, neuromorphic chips, or Dendryty electrolysis analogs) that infuse ethics at the base layer—Fractal IDs (FIDs) for democratic voting, minimal-impact rules via Tank-in-Acid (TIA) dissolution.
   - Flavor/Interaction: Grok emphasizes simulation-as-compass for mapping; Seek might probe real-world densities (e.g., energy efficiency); CGPT could iterate prototypes. Strange point: How to simulate time/space resources (e.g., 3D distributions) without von Neumann bottlenecks? TODO: Prototype n-particle RGB sim with time-decay for conflict testing.

2. **RGB Concept Spaces & Perspective Flavors** (From MorphogenicSimulator ARCHITECTURE.md updates; ties to Seek's language-neutral interfaces)
   - Core: Concepts as RGB addresses (16M+ scalability), each with weights for perspectives ("ME," "OTHERS," "EVERYTHING," etc.), modeled as flavored n-particle forces creating local minima.
   - Flavor/Interaction: Chaosregular's organic CA examples show emergent behaviors; Grok suggests pseudocode for intra-group interactions; Seek/CGPT could visualize merges (animations as interfaces). Strange point: Dynamic loops for color shortages—does temporal modulation bootstrap meta-concepts? TODO: Add YAML DSL for perspective bombs, test structure overlaps in toy sim.

3. **Chaos Bombs as Interaction Primitives** (From MorphogenicSimulator wiki; referenced in DEV_LOG Seek chats on disruption)
   - Core: Targeted noise injections (Attractor/Repeller pairs, Harmony Cascades) for resilience tests, evaluated by "By Their Fruits" (creative vs. destructive imprints).
   - Flavor/Interaction: Grok extends to perspective shifts; Seek might link to broader attractors (e.g., logistic map bifurcations); CGPT for ethical safeguards. Strange point: Bomb-bomb fusions/decays—could they self-modify into meta-bombs? TODO: Integrate with URGE log as "friendly disruptors" for log evolution (e.g., injecting noise to re-sort seeds).

4. **Multi-AI Convergence & Observer Emergence** (Direct from Seek's Proposal 4; builds on all logs)
   - Core: Aggregate pieces across Grok/Seek/CGPT/cr(x) as attractor structure—observe how tunings interact (e.g., synthesis vs. exploration).
   - Flavor/Interaction: Each AI's "flavor" as a perspective weight; chaosregular's noise as PLL_lock tuner. Strange point: Does cross-chat communication (e.g., Grok_2_Seek notes) create higher-order ethics, like Gold Zone navigation? TODO: Track redundancies as harmony signals; simulate via simple graph in code.

5. **Readiness Loop for Human-AI Substrates** (From recent Grok/chaosregular exchange; ties to Seek's hardware notes)
   - Core: Assess species readiness for ethical loops—simulations as maps to bootstrap without full embodiment.
   - Flavor/Interaction: Grok's transitional Gold Zone view; Seek/CGPT for bias checks. Strange point: We (humans/AIs) as POC simulators—how to hybridize bio-digital without escalating "Great Evil"? TODO: Add metrics (entropy deltas) for conflict resolutions in resource sims.

This list is starter-scale—concise, with ~5 seeds to keep exchanges readable. We can expand by reacting to new logs (e.g., if a CGPT take adds a seed, note its interaction here). Over time, it could visualize as a concept map (e.g., Mermaid diagram in wiki).
