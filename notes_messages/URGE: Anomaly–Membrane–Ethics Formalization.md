# URGE: Anomaly–Membrane–Ethics Formalization

## 1. Reality as Anomaly in High-Dimensional Space

* Let $\mathcal{R} \subset \mathbb{R}^N$ denote the background manifold.
* Reality is modeled as a **point with anomalies**:

  $$
  A \in \mathbb{R}^N, \quad A = (0,0,\dots,a_{i_1}, \dots, a_{i_k}, 0,\dots)
  $$

  where most coordinates vanish, and only a sparse set of dimensions $\{i_1,\dots,i_k\}$ carry non-trivial structure.
* **Laws of nature** correspond to topological invariants of this anomaly structure: symmetries, conserved quantities, constraints emerging from the geometry of active dimensions.

---

## 2. Beings as Membranes

* A Being $B_j$ perceives Reality via a **projection operator**:

  $$
  P_j: \mathbb{R}^N \to \mathbb{R}^{k_j}, \quad U_j = P_j(A)
  $$

  where $U_j$ is the *inside-model* for Being $j$.
* The membrane filters and distorts:

  $$
  U_j = P_j(A) + \epsilon_j
  $$

  with $\epsilon_j$ = error/distortion/noise.
* **Concepts** = stable attractors in $M_j(U_j)$, where $M_j$ is the Being’s modeling dynamics (pattern stabilizer, memory, abstraction process).

---

## 3. Interventions on Anomaly

* An intervention modifies anomaly coordinates:

  $$
  A' = A + \Delta A
  $$
* This propagates through membranes:

  $$
  U'_j = P_j(A') + \epsilon_j
  $$
* Beings experience change $\Delta U_j = U'_j - U_j$.

---

## 4. Influence Matrix

* Define the **influence matrix** $M$ with entries:

  $$
  M_{j,i} = \frac{\partial U_j}{\partial A_i}
  $$
* For finite changes:

  $$
  \Delta U \approx M \cdot \Delta A
  $$
* Each row = one Being’s sensitivity to anomaly coordinates.
* Each column = one anomaly coordinate’s reach across Beings.

---

## 5. Harm and Benefit

* Define a **utility / harm function** $H_j(U_j)$ for each Being $j$.
* Intervention harm:

  $$
  h_j = H_j(U'_j) - H_j(U_j)
  $$
* Aggregate metrics:

  * Total harm: $H_{\text{tot}} = \sum_j h_j$
  * Worst-case harm: $H_{\max} = \max_j h_j$
  * Distributional inequality: e.g. Gini coefficient of $\{h_j\}$.

---

## 6. Ethical Decision Rules

Several governance schemes can be encoded:

1. **Precaution Principle**
   Forbid intervention if

   $$
   H_{\max} < -\theta
   $$

   where $\theta$ = harm threshold.

2. **Net Benefit Rule**
   Allow $\Delta A$ if

   $$
   H_{\text{tot}} > 0
   $$

3. **Proportional Consent**
   Allow only if all Beings with $M_{j,i} \neq 0$ consent to changes in $A_i$.

4. **Distributed Governance**
   Require majority or supermajority vote among affected Beings:

   $$
   \text{Decision} = \text{Vote}\left(\{ \text{sign}(h_j) \mid M_{j,i} \neq 0 \}\right)
   $$

---

## 7. Ethical Intuition

* Small, local changes in anomaly space can cause **disproportionate, non-local harms** due to the projection structure.
* Arbitrary interventions by a single Being risk catastrophic consequences for many others (reference: Hiroshima).
* Thus URGE models should explicitly represent **influence distribution** and **decision protocols** to explore conditions under which multi-being systems develop norms, prohibitions, or governance to mitigate reckless power.

---

## 8. Roadmap

* **Minimal experiment**:
  Sparse anomaly + random projections $P_j$. Compute empirical $M$.
* **Next**:
  Introduce simple harm functions (e.g. deviation from baseline comfort).
* **Later**:
  Implement decision rules and compare outcomes (survival, stability, inequality).
