# Resonance-Edge Link v001
URGE ⇄ MorphogenicSimulator integration sketch.

- URGE explores ethical / conceptual attractors in high-dimensional idea-space.  
- MorphogenicSimulator tests morphogenesis and probabilistic coherence at physical-simulation scale.  
- The shared concept: **Resonance Edge** — the boundary where ordered attractors and chaotic flux meet.

Future work:
- Define data interchange between ‘chunks’ (URGE) and ‘cells’ (MS).  
- Measure coherence metrics across both systems.
