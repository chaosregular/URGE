Vision Anchor Point - 2025-09-24  

This file captures key concepts from the visioneering phase that may be revisited in future URGE development.  
Concepts from [Grok's Vision v011](https://github.com/chaosregular/URGE/wiki/Groks_draft_v011_of_URGE_vision) 
- Resonance Networks: A proposed mechanism for agent interaction where agents influence each other's internal states based on similarity or compatibility. This could lead to emergent clusters of aligned agents.

- Cognitive Architecture: A layered model for agents, possibly involving perception, memory, and action. The idea of "emergent semantics" where meaning arises from the interaction of simple agents.

- Morphogenetic Engineering: The goal of designing systems that can self-organize into complex structures, inspired by biological development.

Concepts from [Trace's Output](https://github.com/chaosregular/URGE/wiki/Cgpt_2025_09_23_17_54_00)

- Agent Specialization and Cooperation: The idea of agents having distinct roles (e.g., sensor, processor, actuator) and cooperating to solve problems.

- Evolutionary Learning: A population of agents that adapt over time through a process of variation and selection.

Potential Directions for Future Exploration

- How can resonance networks be implemented in a minimal simulation?

- What is the simplest cognitive architecture that can show emergent semantics?

- How can agent specialization emerge from a homogeneous population?
