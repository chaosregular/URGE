# Reality Ethics Principles v001

1. Simulation as hypothesis: simulations inform but do not replace ethical responsibility in reality.
2. Separation of histories: forward-simulated history is immutable; trajectory reconstructions are labeled hypotheses.
3. No real-world interventions without: reproducible evidence, consent of affected parties, and governance sign-off.
4. Auditability: all runs and transforms must be logged with provenance.
5. Conservative default: absent high-certainty and consent, do not act.
