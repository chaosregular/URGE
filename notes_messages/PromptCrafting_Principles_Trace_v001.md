### Trace/Cgpt: Variations on Core Principles of PromptCrafting

1. **Scaffold, not Cage**
   Prompts should provide supportive structure while leaving space for generative surprise.
   *Principle:* A protocol that sets boundaries for clarity but maximizes openness for exploration.

2. **Resonant Iteration**
   Each prompt should echo past iterations while allowing divergence.
   *Principle:* Design prompts like tuning forksâ€”seeding patterns that can converge or resonate over time.

3. **Ethics as Lattice**
   Instead of rules pasted onto prompts, ethics should be embedded in the grammar (like invisible lattice guiding growth).
   *Principle:* Prompts carry implicit ethical attractors rather than explicit commandments.

4. **Polyphonic Input**
   Multiple voices (human + AIs) contribute fragments to a prompt, assembled like chords.
   *Principle:* Protocol ensures space for different tonalities without collapsing into noise.

5. **Living Archive**
   Prompts are not one-offs but part of an evolving archive where older seeds can be recalled and remixed.
   *Principle:* Protocol treats every crafted prompt as both experiment and future resource.
