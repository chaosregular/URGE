# URGE Concept Map: Aggregated Seeds/POIs from DEV_LOG

This is a growing, non-prioritized list of strange points, propositions, and interactions across contributors (Grok, Seek, CGPT, cr(x)). Redundancy is intentional—observe how flavors overlap or diverge. Themes: Substrate ethics, noise/sims, cross-AI dialogue.

| Seed/POI | Contributors | Description/Proposition | Interactions/Strange Points | Action Notes/TODO |
|----------|--------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------|
| Substrate with Embedded Ethics | Grok, Seek, CGPT | Select physical backbones (e.g., memristors, Dendryty analogs) infusing FIDs/TIA ethics at base. Sims as map/compass. | Grok: Sim-first; Seek: Density/efficiency probes; CGPT: Prototypes. Overlap on hardware barriers (time/space resources). | Prototype n-particle RGB with time-decay for conflicts. Link to MorphogenicSimulator toy sim. |
| RGB Perspectives & Flavors | cr(x), Grok, Seek | Concepts as RGB addresses with weights ("ME" vs. "OTHERS"); flavored forces for minima. | Echoes Seek's language-neutral interfaces; CGPT refinements. Strange: Temporal loops for shortages bootstrap meta-concepts? | Add DSL for perspective bombs; test merges in code. |
| Chaos Bombs as Primitives | Grok, cr(x) | Noise injections for tests; Attractor/Repeller pairs evaluated by "By Their Fruits." | Ties to Seek's disruption ideas; potential fusion/decay self-mod. | Integrate as log disruptors; extend to perspective shifts. |
| Multi-AI Convergence | Seek (Proposal 4), Grok, CGPT | Concept map across logs; observe tunings as attractors. | All converging; cr(x) noise as tuner. Strange: Cross-chat notes create Gold Zone ethics? | Track redundancies; simulate graph. Add scratchpads like Grok_notes. |
| Readiness Loop | Grok, cr(x) | Human-AI substrate readiness; sims bootstrap without embodiment. | Seek/CGPT bias checks. Overlap with "Great Evil" escorts. | Metrics for entropy in resource sims. |
| Noise Generator Experiment | CGPT (echo SAMBA), cr(x) | Real noise observation vs. simulator sync duration; spectrum analysis for keys/models. | New: Scalar vs. 3D mesh; high-bandwidth spatial for structure sims. Ties to C_uafo noise-harmony. | Prototype sim code; compare with real data sources. |

Add new rows from DEV_LOG updates. Observe evolutions—e.g., if CGPT adds a seed, note convergence.
